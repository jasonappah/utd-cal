todo one day: make this a bookmarklet? i could see this being helpful to others + wouldn't be hard, would need to:
- modify script to...
  - make the semester request and use data from the response instead of the copy-paste data approach
  - make the cal output to a file download using browser apis instead of writing fs apis
- move this into my main website repo
- create a page in my website w setup steps + directions

## Getting Started

```sh
bun create blank ./NAME_HERE
```
